#  Natureâ€™s Remedy: Gluten Combo Test

An interactive web-based tool that predicts gluten breakdown effectiveness using natural plant extracts such as **papaya, pineapple, ginger, turmeric, and aloe vera** â€” based on real experimental data.

---

##  Project Overview

This website simulates an experiment testing how natural plant enzymes might help break down gluten proteins.  
It was inspired by a student science fair project testing natural extracts and combinations on gluten samples using protein test strips.

---

##  Features

- Interactive Combo Test: 
  Select up to three natural extracts to see predicted gluten degradation (in g/L).
  
- **Scientific Data-Based Predictions: 
  Built using results from real lab testing of combinations like:  
  - Combo A: Pineapple + Ginger + Aloe Vera  
  - Combo B: Papaya + Turmeric + Ginger  
  - Combo C: Papaya + Pineapple + Ginger

- Clean, Lightweight Frontend:  
  Made with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” no backend required.

## How It Works

Each extract and combination has a measured or calculated gluten level:

| Extract / Combo | Estimated Gluten (g/L) | Effectiveness |
|------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| Pineapple (Bromelain) | 0.3 | Very Low (Strong breakdown) |
| Papaya (Papain) | 1.1 | Moderate |
| Ginger | 10.0 | High (Minimal breakdown) |
| Turmeric | 1.0 | Moderate |
| Aloe Vera | 0.3 | Very Low |
| Combo A (Pineapple + Ginger + Aloe) | 0.3 | Very Low |
| Combo B (Papaya + Turmeric + Ginger) | 1.2 | Moderate |
| Combo C (Papaya + Pineapple + Ginger) | 1.0 | Low-Moderate |

Predictions are calculated using averages and synergy adjustments for enzyme-rich combinations.
